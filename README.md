## 🏢 SaaS / Commercial Platforms

The machine image building market is split between hyperscaler-native services (AWS, Azure, GCP) that integrate deeply with their respective cloud ecosystems, and vendor-specific tooling for enterprise Linux distributions (Red Hat, Canonical, Oracle). Pricing models vary: AWS EC2 Image Builder itself is free but the underlying compute, storage, and networking costs accrue [citation:1][citation:11], Azure VM Image Builder is similarly free with underlying resource charges [citation:2][citation:12], Red Hat Image Builder requires an active RHEL subscription (available free via Developer Subscription) [citation:4], and Canonical's Ubuntu Pro image building capabilities are available as part of Ubuntu Pro subscriptions starting at ~3.5% of underlying compute cost on public clouds [citation:14].

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

- This is a **community-curated** list — not exhaustive and not an endorsement. ℹ️
- Machine image building can incur significant cloud costs if pipelines are not properly managed. AWS EC2 Image Builder and Azure VM Image Builder are free services, but underlying compute, storage, and networking charges accumulate [citation:1][citation:2]. **Monitor pipeline usage and clean up temporary resources**. 🔒
- Open-source tools (HashiCorp Packer, Distrobuilder, Ansible Builder) provide self-hosted ownership and multi-cloud flexibility, but enterprise-grade SLA guarantees, managed artifact registries, and vendor support remain primarily commercial offerings. 🖼️
